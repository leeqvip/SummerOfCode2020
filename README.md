The student will be more likely selected if he/she:

4. Provide a personal website and descriptions for previous work/projects.
5. Provide demo sites for the previous projects if possible.
6. Provide a resume/CV.

## Idea list

### 1. Casbin Dashboard

#### Description

Build a web UI dashboard/admin portal for Casbin & Casbin-Server. It can:

1. Manage models, adapters, enforcers. The adapter manager should handle different DBs.
2. Model editor with a syntax and semantic validator.
3. Policy editor, it should be able to handle 10,000+ more rules.
4. A test page to make example request to Casbin and get response, like Postman. So users can test their model and policy.
5. Authentication and authorization for the dashboard itself. Of course authorization will be implemented in Casbin (we proudly dogfood our own product :))

The current progress is: https://dashboard.casbin.org/. Source code: https://github.com/casbin/casbin-dashboard. We want the student to continue the work.

#### Requirements

1. Golang (backend)
2. Javascript + React + Ant Design (frontend)
3. Casbin

#### Mentor

[Yang Luo](https://github.com/hsluoyz), Casbin founder

### 2. A PHP extension for Casbin, implemented by C/C ++.

#### Description

We now have a version implemented by PHP language: [PHP-Casbin](https://github.com/php-casbin/php-casbin), but we prefer to make a PHP extension through C/C ++ to improve performance.
It needs to implement the full functionality of Casbin.

#### Requirements

1. C/C++
2. PHP
3. Casbin

#### Mentor
